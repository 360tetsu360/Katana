# Katana

A new Minecraft Bedrock Edition server software, written in C++.

I am in need of desperate help haha. Networking is hard.
. 
### Building

CMake is required. Better building instructions will come later.

1. `git clone --recursive https://github.com/ProjectKatana/Katana`
2. `cd Katana`
3. `cmake . && cmake --build .`
  
### Goals

* Support multiple platforms (linux/windows/android/ios)
* Better performance than any other software
* Great plugin system with support for other languages ;)
